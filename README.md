# Dice_Roll_Game

We'll use the Random.Next() method to simulate rolling three 6-sided dice. We'll evaluate the values to calculate the score. If the score is greater than an arbitrary total, then we'll display a winning message to the user. Otherwise, we'll display a losing message to the user.

- If any two dice you roll result in the same value, you get two bonus points for rolling doubles.
- If all three dice you roll result in the same value, you get six bonus points for rolling triples.
- If the sum of the three dice rolls, plus any point bonuses, is 15 or greater, you win the game. Otherwise, you lose.
